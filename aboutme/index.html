        <h1>Brian Lewis Intro</h1>
        <pre>
        Aloha everyone! My name is Brian and I live in Denver, CO with my wife Alena.  We have two adult sons who live in Colorado also.
        The last decade or so has had me in a variety of places around the world and I enjoy different cultures, languages and food.
        
        This has included growing up in Alaska, serving as a missionary in Japan, going to school in Utah, working in Colorado, and
        doing business in the UK, Germany, Italy, Greece, Cyprus, Jordan, UAE, and Qatar.  My current hobby is learning how to invest
        in cryptocurrencies and play crypto-based games.
        
        I look forward to learning more about programming in html this semester and working with the rest of you in that journey.
