      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I plan on building a website that visualizes my professional background by highlighting the different areas of expertise, professional experience, and education & certifications, I've gained over the last 30 years.  The primary audience will be prospective clients/employers and help to create a portfolio of businesses and clients I've served.  I anticipate this will require a main page and 2 supporting pages.  I'll draw on prior material I've created to provide the core content and try to visualize it in a concise and impactful manner.

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience is prospective employers or clients that might be interested in learning more about who I am and what are competencies.
